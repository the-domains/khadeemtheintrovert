**An Introverted personality.....**in so many ways hinder you from expressing yourself. But in many ways leads you down the right path. For example, if it wasn't for my introverted-ness I would not have thought about my choices so deeply. Mathematically analyzing the best choice leading me to meet inspirational people. Also, if it wasn't for it I wouldn't have missed so many opportunities by over analyzing. There are positives and negatives to being the way I'm. I think the secret is like what**Gary Vaynerchuckalways says have self-****awareness.**

Then use the strengths of your personality to your advantage and become aware of your weaknesses.
